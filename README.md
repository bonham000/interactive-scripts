# interactive-scripts

List all of your npm scripts from `package.json` and run one of your choosing in just one short command :)

## Installation

Just add this to your global `npm` packages like so: `npm install --global interactive-scripts` or `yarn global add interactive-scripts`.

## Usage

After installing globally with `npm` or `yarn`, simply run `scripts` in your terminal.

See the example gif where I demonstrate its use in an actual project:
